## Contributing
You want to contribute to CrazePy? Great! We use LLVM code style and thanks to clang-format, you don't have to format the code all by yourself. Just take something from the checklist (or add a feature that you'd like to add) and start working on it! For questions, you can always contact me or use GitHub issues.
